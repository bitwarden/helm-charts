# This workflow is intended to be run when we need to test the helm charts on the PR target.
# This workflow will run in the context of the target of the PR and have access to secrets.
# This should only be done after reviewing the PR to ensure that no malicious code has been introduced,
# as it could allow the code on the forked branch to have access to workflow secrets.
